<h4>c variables</h4>
<p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
<br>
<p>In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
<ul><li>int</li>
<li>float</li>
<li>char</li>
</ul>
<hr color="brown">
<h4>Declaring of variables</h4>
<p>variables can be declared in two ways
</p>
<h4>indirect declaration</h4>
<p>
int myNum;
<br>
myNum = 15;
<br></p>
<h4>direct declaration</h4>
<p>
int myNum=15;
<br>
Here int is the type of data that a variable is storing...and myNum is the variable and we are initializing 15 to our variable.
</p>
<hr color="brown">
<h4>Example</h4><br>
void main() {<br>
  int myNum = 15;
<br>
  printf("%d",myNum);
<br>
}
<br><br>
<button type="button" onclick="alert('15')">output</button>
<br>

<h4>Identifiers in c</h4>

<p>C identifiers represent the name in the C program, for example, variables, functions, arrays, structures, unions, labels, etc.<br> An identifier can be composed of letters such as uppercase, lowercase letters, underscore, digits, but the starting letter should be either an alphabet or an underscore.
</p>
<h4>Rules of constructing identifiers</h4>
<ol><li>The first character of an identifier should be either an alphabet or an underscore, and then it can be followed by any of the character, digit, or underscore.</li>
<li>It should not begin with any numerical digit</li>
<li>In identifiers, both uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct. Therefore, we can say that identifiers are case sensitive.</li>
<li>Commas or blank spaces cannot be specified within an identifier.</li>
<li>Keywords cannot be represented as an identifier.</li>
<li>The length of the identifiers should not be more than 31 characters.</li>
<li>Identifiers should be written in such a way that it is meaningful, short, and easy to read.</li>
</ol>

<h4>comments in c</h4>
<p>Comments in C language are used to provide information about lines of code. It is widely used for documenting code.<br>
 There are 2 types of comments in the C language.</p>
<ol><li>Single-line comments</li>
<li>Multi-line comments</li>
<h4>Single line comments</h4>
<p>Single line comments are represented by double slash \\. Let's see an example of a single line comment in C.<br>
void main() {<br>
  int myNum = 15;
<br>
//this is single line comment
<br>
  printf("%d",myNum);
<br>
}
</p>
<h4>Multi-line comments</h4>

<p>Multi-Line comments are represented by slash asterisk \* ... *\. It can occupy many lines of code, but it can't be nested.
void main() {<br>
  int myNum = 15;
<br>
/*this is Multi line comment*\
<br>
  printf("%d",myNum);
<br>
}
</p>
