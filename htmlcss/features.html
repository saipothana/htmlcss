<p><h4><a id="1">Simple</a></h4><br>
C is a simple language in the sense that it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), the rich set of <strong>library functions, data types, etc.</strong></p><hr color="brown">
<p><h4><a id="2">Portable</a></h4><br>
Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed on <b>different machines with some machine specific changes.</b> Therefore, C is a machine independent language.</p><hr color="brown">
<p><h4><a id="3">Mid level language</a></h4><br>
Although, C is intended to do low-level programming. It is used to develop system applications such as <b>kernel, driver, etc.</b> It also supports the features of a high-level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.</p><hr color="brown">
<p><h4><a id="4">fast speed</a></h4><br>
The compilation and execution time of C language is fast since there are lesser inbuilt functions and hence the lesser overhead.</p><hr color="brown">
<p><h4><a id="5">Pointers</a></h4><br>
C provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by using the pointers. We can use pointers for <b>memory, structures, functions, array, etc.</b>
<p><h4><a id="6">Recursion</a></h4><br>
In C, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function. Recursion enables us to use the approach of backtracking.</p><hr color="brown">
<p><h4><a id="7">rich library</a></h4><br>
C provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.</p><hr color="brown">
