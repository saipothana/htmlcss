<h1 align="center"><font color="blue">Programing languages</font></h1>
<p>To wrie a program a standard language is used. A program is consists of set of instructions and the programing language is classified into two types</p>
<h4><ul type="diso"><li><a href="#hl">Lowlevel language</a></li><li><a href="#ll">High level language</a></li></ul></h4><img align="right" src="low.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="low levelpic"><br>
<p><h4><a id="hl">Lowlevel language</a></h4>
A low-level language, often known as a computer's native language, is a sort of programming language.<br>It is very close to writing actual machine instructions, and it deals with a computer's hardware components and constraints.<br> It works to control a computer's operational semantics and provides little or no abstraction of programming ideas.<br> In contrast to high-level language that used for developing software, low-level code is not human-readable, and it is often cryptic. Assembly language and machine language are two examples of low-level programming languages.
<br>
<strong>Low level language is classified into two types:</Strong>
<ul><li>Machine language</li>
<li>Assembly language</li><ul>

<p><h4 color ="green"><a id="ll">Highlevel language</a></h4>
High-level languages are designed to be used by the human operator or the programmer.<br>
They are referred to as "closer to humans." In other words, their programming style and context is easier to learn and implement than low-level languages, and the entire code generally focuses on the specific program to be created.
<br>
A high-level language does not require addressing hardware constraints when developing a program.<br>
 However, every single program written in a high-level language must be interpreted into machine language before being executed by the computer.

BASIC, <strong>C/C++</strong> and <strong>Java</strong> are popular examples of high-level languages.
